try-with-resources statement examples
===========================
The project is intended to show different ways to compile a try-with-resources statement. In the resources you can find precompiled examples for javac, ECJ and AspecJ compilers together with a Java bytecode in the text form. To pretty print a bytecode [Textifier](http://asm.ow2.org/asm50/javadoc/user/org/objectweb/asm/util/Textifier.html) was using.
